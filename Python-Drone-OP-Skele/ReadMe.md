# Drone-Operator GUI

The objective of this application is to be able to assign drones to operators in a given 'case scenario'. A skeleton of the code was given in each step of the project.
Each step generally required the implementation of a database and code to collect, store and edit data in the database.
- This project included SQL coding
- A little bit of python implementation
- writing unit tests using the unittest module
