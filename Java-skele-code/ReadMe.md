# A Java GUI for interactive shapes

Most of this code was given to us as part of the project, meaning only a few of the functions and files were created by me.
They are:
- A1.java -> draw()
- A1.java -> contains()
- MovingRectangle.java
- MovingSquare.java
- MovingQuadPie.java
- MovingSquarePattern.java
- CircularPath.java
