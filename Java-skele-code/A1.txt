Roughly spent 1-2 hours everyday over 2 weeks, so an estimated 15 hours collectively (this included thinking, planning and going over notes).

The easier sections of the assignment were changing the array to an array list and drawing the simple shapes, shapes without patterns. The patterned shapes were a bit more difficult as it required another implemented draw method in the parent tree to remove one of the bounds/colours in addition to it's own to draw the patterns.

The assignment helped me understand the concepts of inheritance and the super/sub heirachy. How a subclass defaultly inherits the super class's methods and how they can be called using the 'super' call.
